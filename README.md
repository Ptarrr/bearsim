WoW Guardian combat simulation

If you just want to have stat weights for your own stats, you should only edit Stats.js
If you want to test some fancy new way of spending rage, you should look at Strat.js and ThingsToRun.js
If you want to simulate some other boss fight, look at Boss.js

The other files are only of interest if you want to validate or extend this simulation.
